  	"introduction":"The questionnairesâ€™ origin (sources from which elements of the questionnaire are derived) and initial development (process of making a questionnaire from elements) should be assessed before their measurement properties. To develop the Questionnaire Origin and Development Appraisal (QODA) tool, we first developed QODA version-one from psychometric tool development guidelines, and pilot tested it, resulting in QODA version-two. Second, we performed a review that identified six CATs that evaluate origin and initial development. A pool of items was derived from these six CATs and QODA version-two. Using a nominal group method, this item pool was reduced and QODA version-three (20 items) was developed. The QODA may be useful to academic librarians who assist researchers and students from various disciplines. Information professionals including research trainees can learn how to use QODA and ensure sound questionnaire origin and initial development. This will improve the accuracy of data collected in research and professional practice (e.g., information service evaluation)."
